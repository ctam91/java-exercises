#Find the nth Fibonacci 

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . .
    Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. Given an input, return the number at that position. 
    
  

    input n
    n = what number is at this position?
            for example: n=5, should return 3

    approach:
            1) fibonnaci sequence: (n-1) + (n-2)
            2) for loop
